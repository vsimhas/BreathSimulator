  * @brief   Hose / tube pressure-drop compensator.
  *
  *  Why this exists
  *  ---------------
  *  The pressure sensor (AMS5935 hamsPS) sits inside the device, not at the
  *  mask. While the patient is breathing, flow through the hose introduces
  *  a pressure drop, so
  *
  *      P_sensor  !=  P_mask
  *
  *  even when a conventional CPAP loop is "perfectly tracking setpoint".
  *  The user-visible symptom is a mask pressure that visibly oscillates
  *  with each breath when the hose has appreciable resistance (every
  *  hose >= 15 mm x 1.5 m does).
  *
  *  This module implements the standard quadratic hose-resistance model
  *
  *      dP_hose(Q)  =  R_lam * |Q|   +   R_turb * Q * |Q|       [cmH2O]
  *      P_mask      =  P_sensor      -   sign(Q) * |dP_hose|    [cmH2O]
  *
  *  with Q in L/min (slm-equivalent) and the two coefficients chosen for
  *  the specific hose. Typical adult-CPAP hoses (1.8 m, 15-22 mm ID):
  *
  *      hose                R_lam              R_turb
  *      -----------------------------------------------------
  *      22 mm corrugated    ~0.001             ~0.00005
  *      15 mm slimline      ~0.002             ~0.00018
  *      ClimateLineAir 15   ~0.002             ~0.00012
  *
  *  Numbers are from regression of the standard CPAP industry curves;
  *  recalibrate per hose if you have a flow rig.
  *
  *  Calibration procedure (no flow rig, only the device):
  *      1. Block the patient end of the hose tightly with a plug.
  *      2. Run the device at a known steady RPM. Q falls almost to 0
  *         (only the vent leak flows). Note P_sensor.
  *      3. Replace the plug with the *intentional* mask vent only (no
  *         leaks, no patient). Q rises to ~30-50 slm. Note P_sensor and
  *         Q_total at the same RPM.
  *      4. The pressure delta between (2) and (3) divided by Q_total
  *         from (3) gives R_turb (assuming R_lam ~ 0).
  *
  *  Use
  *  ---
  *  Call TubeComp_Apply() with the freshly-converted sensor pressure and
  *  flow on every PID tick. It returns the mask-pressure estimate. The
  *  PID consumes that estimate as its measurement, so closed-loop
  *  control regulates *mask* pressure, not sensor pressure. The leak
  *  estimator reads BlowerCtrl_GetMeasured() and therefore picks up the
  *  same estimate automatically.
